# Comments parser

This experiment is supposed to show how HTML comments of the form

```html
<!-- Node: {"identifier":"4e7e03f1-06b3-4dad-8245-01732b4d0169"} -->
```

could be utilized to replace Neos CMS' content element wrapping.

The technique used to globally extract HTML comments from a page is described here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/13364065
